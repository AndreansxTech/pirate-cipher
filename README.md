## As of 20.02.2025 the TURN/STUN server used by this project is NO LONGER ACTIVE
Connections will still work in one LAN. If you want, you can implement your own TURN/STUN server by making changes to the TURN server settings in the script.js file.


# My Neo P2P Chat

A browser-based peer-to-peer encrypted chat application with file sharing capabilities and a modern UI design. Built with WebRTC for direct peer connections and AES encryption for secure messaging and it uses my own TURN/STUN server.

## Latest update‚ùó
One of the admins of the event that I made this project for pointed out that he has been getting errors when joining. I checked and he was right. I really struggled with how to make it work. The main problem was the TURN server. So I simply made my own. I created a droplet on DigitalOcean and ran a Coturn server there. 
## Website
### You can check out and communicate now with people in different places by visiting https://my-neo-p2p-chat.pages.dev/

## Below is a video showing what I fixed
There are two devices. The laptop is on my local network connected to the website and the smartphone is connected to a cellular network. As you can see, I am able to communicate between those two devices.

## Technical Details

### Core Technologies
- HTML5 & CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript 
- TailwindCSS for styling

- CryptoJS for encryption
- Coturn for self-hosting of the TURN server that helps with NAT problems

### Key Files
- [index.html](index.html) - Main application UI
- [script.js](script.js) - Core application logic
- [styles.css](styles.css) - Custom CSS styling

## Browser Support

WebRTC and modern JavaScript support required.

## Development

To modify or enhance:

1. Clone the repository
2. Edit files directly - no build step needed
3. Open index.html locally 

### The project is currently using my STUN/TURN server because the public ones are working so bad that you littelary could not make a connection. You can make your own by paying for a droplet on DigitalOcean ( or any web-capable server with SSH access ) and installing <a href="https://github.com/coturn/coturn">Coturn</a> there. 
```
sudo apt-get install coturn
```
Then you will need to modify the configuration files accordingly to you.
